# Problem - To-Do List Web Application

Your mission is to develop a basic To-Do List web application. You have the flexibility to use fundamental HTML, CSS, and JavaScript or opt for a broader range of web stacks, such as React, Bootstrap, Angular, Laravel, or even WebAssembly (WASM). This application must enable users to seamlessly add, modify, and remove tasks, each characterized by a title, description, status (complete or pending), and priority. The design should be clean and intuitive.

## Requirements

1. Create a user interface using HTML and CSS to display a list of tasks.
2. Implement functionality using JavaScript to add new tasks, edit existing tasks, and mark tasks as completed or not.
3. Allow users to input a title and description for each task.
4. Implement a feature to prioritize tasks (e.g., high, medium, low).
5. Display tasks with appropriate styling to indicate their completion status.
6. Provide options to edit or delete tasks.

## Evaluation Criteria

1. Correct implementation of task creation, editing, and deletion.
2. Proper handling of task status and user interactions.
3. Clear and concise indication of task priority.
4. User interface design and user experience.
5. Code organization, clarity, and maintainability.
6. Proper usage of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
7. Documentation explaining how to run the application and any additional features you've implemented.

## Bonus (Optional)

1. Ensure responsive design, so the web application is usable on both desktop and mobile devices.
2. Add animations or transitions to enhance the user experience.
